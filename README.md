## ER Diagram
A fictional ER diagram I've created of an Employees database. 

### What is a data model?
A data model organizes elements of data and standardizes how they
relate to one another and properties of real-world entities.

### Why is data modeling important?
* Organizes data across multiple tables to more easily maintain tables
* Organizes data and determines later data use
* Begin prior to build out apps, business logic, and analytical model
* It is an iterative process

### Relational Data Models
* Organizes data into tables with a unique key identifying each row
* Structure of how data looks.
### Relational Database
* Digital database based on relational model of data
* A software system used to maintain relational database is a relational database management system (RDBMS)
* MySql, PostgreSql, Oracle, MSSQL, etc

### Basics of relational database
Database/Schema is a collection of tables
Tables/Relations are a group of rows sharing the same labeled elements

### Advantages of using a Relational Database
* Ease of use - SQL
* Ability to join tables
* Ability to do aggregations and analytics
* Smaller data volumes
* Flexibility of Queries
* ACID transactions - Data Integrity
